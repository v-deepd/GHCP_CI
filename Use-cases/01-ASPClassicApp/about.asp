<h1>About Classic ASP Store</h1>

<div class="about-content">
    <p>Welcome to Classic ASP Store, a demonstration of Classic ASP technology still in use today.</p>

    <p>Our mission is to provide a simple, working example of an ASP Classic e-commerce application that developers can learn from and extend.</p>
    
    <h2>Technology</h2>
